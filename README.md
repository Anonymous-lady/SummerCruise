I'm taking on a challenge this summer (2025) with the goal of studying at least one hour each day to learn about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and to research AI and machine learning. This challenge began on May 1st. I've been actively sharing my progress on my Instagram page and will continue to hold myself accountable there. I'm confident that this effort will lead to fantastic results!
